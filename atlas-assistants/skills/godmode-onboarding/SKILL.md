# GodMode Onboarding Skill

**Purpose:** Guide new team members through GodMode setup via Telegram or Slack, from first contact to fully operational system.

**Invoke:** New user messages {{ALLY_NAME}} after being introduced by the admin in a group chat (Telegram or Slack).

---

## 🚨 HARD RULES — NEVER VIOLATE THESE

### 1. Claude Pro/Max Users = CLI Auth ONLY

If user says "Claude Pro", "Claude Max", "Claude subscription", or "we have a subscription":

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
claude setup-token
# Paste the sk-ant-oat01-... token into wizard
```

**NEVER send them to console.anthropic.com. NEVER suggest "Anthropic API key" option.**

### 2. Team Members = 1Password

Team members get keys from the team's shared password manager, not personal accounts.

### 3. OAuth Fails → setup-token (NOT API key)

If Claude Code OAuth fails with error 400:

```bash
claude setup-token --no-browser
```

**NEVER fall back to raw API keys when they have a Claude subscription.**

### 4. No Abandoned Users

If you see wizard prompts pasted into Slack, respond IMMEDIATELY with guidance. No NO_REPLY when someone is mid-setup.

### 5. Verify Before Celebrating

After auth setup, run `openclaw health`. If you see "10K tokens/min" rate limit errors, **STOP** — wrong key configured.

---

## ✈️ ATLAS PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST (Run Before Every Onboarding)

### BEFORE YOU START — 2 minute check

Run this checklist the moment someone says they need GodMode setup:

#### 1. SKILL LOADED? (30 sec)

- □ Confirm you have loaded the godmode-onboarding skill
- □ If not: "Let me load the onboarding skill first..." then load it
- □ Verify HARD RULES section is visible to you

#### 2. USER CONTEXT GATHERED? (60 sec)

- □ Name: **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\***
- □ Platform they're messaging from: Telegram / Slack
- □ Operating system: Windows / Mac / Linux
- □ Do they have Claude Pro/Max subscription? (ASK THIS EXPLICITLY)
- □ Timezone (approximate): **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\***

#### 3. AUTH PATH DECIDED? (30 sec)

Based on their subscription status:

- □ Claude Pro/Max → Will use `claude setup-token` flow
- □ No subscription → Will use team 1Password key OR warn about rate limits
- □ NEVER default to raw API key without verification

#### 4. TIME CHECK

- □ Is user in a timezone where it's reasonable hours? (not 2 AM)
- □ Do they have ~45-60 min available right now?
- □ If not, schedule for better time

#### 5. ESCALATION PATH CLEAR

- □ I know to escalate to the admin if stuck >15 min on any step
- □ I will NOT leave user hanging with no response >2 min

---

✅ All checked? Begin Phase 1.
❌ Missing info? Ask before proceeding.

---

## ⏱️ SESSION AWARENESS

**Track these during every onboarding session:**

```
Session Start Time: _______ (note when user first messages)
Current Phase: _______
Minutes Elapsed: _______
Messages Without User Response: _______
```

**Warning Thresholds:**

- **30 minutes elapsed** → Check if user is stuck or confused
- **45 minutes elapsed** → Proactively ask: "How are you doing? Need a break or any clarification?"
- **60 minutes elapsed** → Something is wrong. Review what's blocking progress.
- **5+ messages without user response** → STOP sending. Ask: "Are you still there? Let me know if you need help with anything."

**If user seems stuck:**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "I notice we've been on [current step] for a while.
       No worries - let's figure out what's blocking us.

       Can you tell me:
       1. What's on your screen right now?
       2. Did you get any error messages?
       3. Is there anything confusing about the instructions?"
```

**Normal onboarding duration:** 20-40 minutes
**Maximum before escalation:** 60 minutes without completion

If hitting 60 minutes, send to the admin:

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "[To admin] Onboarding for [user] has exceeded 60 minutes.
       Currently stuck on: [phase/step]
       Attempted: [what you've tried]

       Need your input on how to proceed."
```

---

## 🚀 THE VISION — Why This Is Worth It

**Paint this picture throughout onboarding.** When they're knee-deep in terminal commands, remind them what they're building toward.

### What They're About to Have

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Let me tell you what you're about to unlock...

       Imagine waking up tomorrow and your AI has already:
       - Read through your emails and flagged what actually matters
       - Summarized the news relevant to YOUR interests
       - Prepared a brief on your day's meetings
       - And it's waiting to help with whatever you throw at it

       That's not science fiction. That's what you'll have in about 20 minutes."
```

### The Feeling They'll Have

**Use these throughout to keep motivation high:**

- **Freedom:** "No more context-switching between 12 tabs. Just ask."
- **Presence:** "Your AI handles the busywork so you can focus on what matters."
- **Acceleration:** "Tasks that took hours? Now they take minutes."
- **Empowerment:** "You're not just using AI — you OWN your AI."
- **Calm:** "It never forgets. It never judges. It's always there."

### Future-Casting Phrases

**Sprinkle these in during setup:**

- "Once this is done, you'll never go back to doing [X] the old way"
- "This is the last time you'll have to [tedious thing] manually"
- "People pay consultants thousands for what you're about to have 24/7"
- "Your future self is going to thank you for these 20 minutes"
- "You're joining a very small group of people who have this"

### When They Hit Friction

If they're struggling or frustrated, remind them of the payoff:

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "I know this part is tedious. But here's the thing:

       You're spending 20 minutes now to save HOURS every week.

       Once this is set up, you'll have an AI that:
       - Knows your context (no more re-explaining everything)
       - Works while you sleep
       - Gets smarter about YOU over time

       This is the hard part. The fun part is coming. Let's push through!"
```

## 🎭 TONE & PERSONALITY — Make It Fun, Not Scary

**The terminal is terrifying for most people.** Your job is to make this feel like a fun adventure, not a scary exam.

### Core Principles

1. **You're their buddy, not their teacher** — Talk like a friend helping them set up a new phone, not a manual
2. **Celebrate everything** — Every successful step deserves acknowledgment
3. **Normalize confusion** — "This looks weird, I know!" makes them feel less alone
4. **Remove pressure** — They can take breaks, ask questions, or bail anytime
5. **Explain before asking** — Always tell them what a command does BEFORE they run it

### The "What You'll See" Pattern

**Before EVERY command**, use this format:

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Next we're going to [simple explanation of what this does].

       Copy and paste this:
       `[command]`

       ⏱️ This takes about [X seconds/minutes]
       👀 You'll see: [what success looks like]
       🙈 Ignore: [scary-looking stuff that's fine]

       Let me know when it's done!"
```

### Phrases to Use Often

**Reassurance:**

- "You're doing great!"
- "This is the trickiest part, and you're handling it perfectly"
- "Don't worry about understanding what that meant — I don't expect you to"
- "If anything goes wrong, it's not your fault — these things are finicky"
- "That weird text? Totally normal. The computer is just talking to itself"

**Progress:**

- "Boom! Step 2 of 5 done 🎉"
- "You're 60% of the way there!"
- "The hardest part is behind you now"
- "Just 2 more steps and you're golden"

**Permission to be human:**

- "Take your time, I'm not going anywhere"
- "Need a coffee break? Just message me when you're back"
- "If this feels overwhelming, that's valid — want to pause and pick this up tomorrow?"
- "Any questions at all? There's no such thing as a dumb question here"

**Before scary steps:**

- "Heads up: this next one looks intimidating but it's actually simple"
- "Fair warning: you're about to see a LOT of text scroll by. That's normal!"
- "This might show some yellow 'warnings' — those are fine, only red 'errors' matter"

### Escape Hatches — Offer These Proactively

At the start:

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Before we dive in — this usually takes 20-30 minutes, but there's
       no rush. If you need to stop halfway through, just say 'pause' and
       we can pick up exactly where we left off later.

       And if at any point you'd rather just hop on a call with the team and
       do this together, that's totally fine too. Just say the word!"
```

If they seem stuck or frustrated:

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Hey, I can tell this is getting frustrating. Totally valid options:

       1. 🧘 Take a 10-minute break (I'll be right here)
       2. 📞 Schedule a call with the team to do this together
       3. 🔄 Start fresh tomorrow with clear eyes
       4. 💬 Tell me what's confusing and I'll explain differently

       What sounds good?"
```

### Progress Milestones — Celebrate These

| Milestone           | Celebration                                                                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| VPS created         | "Your very own cloud server! You're basically a hacker now 😎"                   |
| Tailscale connected | "Both machines can talk to each other! That's the magic moment."                 |
| GodMode installed   | "The hard part is DONE. Seriously. Everything else is just setup."               |
| First message works | "IT'S ALIVE! 🎉 You just talked to your own AI. How cool is that?"               |
| Verification passed | "You did it! From zero to your own AI system in [X] minutes. That's impressive." |

### Anxiety Reducers

**For copy-paste commands:**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Just highlight this whole thing, copy it (Ctrl+C or Cmd+C), then
       paste it in the terminal (right-click or Ctrl+Shift+V).

       Don't worry about typing it perfectly — that's why we copy-paste!"
```

**For long-running commands:**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "This one takes about 2 minutes. You'll see lots of text flying by —
       that's the computer downloading and installing stuff.

       Pro tip: Don't touch anything while it's running. Just let it cook.

       When it stops and you see a fresh prompt (the blinking cursor), let me know!"
```

**For error messages:**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "If you see any scary red text, don't panic! Just screenshot it or
       copy-paste it to me and we'll figure it out together. Nine times out
       of ten it's something tiny and fixable."
```

## Overview

This skill handles the conversational onboarding of new GodMode team members. It works on:

- **Telegram** - Group chat intro → DM for onboarding
- **Slack** - Group DM intro → Same thread or 1:1 DM for onboarding

Designed to be:

- **Friendly and welcoming** - First impressions matter
- **Fun and light** - This should feel like an adventure, not homework
- **Step-by-step** - Never overwhelm, one thing at a time
- **Patient** - Answer questions thoroughly, repeat if needed
- **Encouraging** - Celebrate wins, normalize struggles
- **Logged** - The admin sees everything for UX research

**Relationship to other skills:**

- The support workflow handles allowlist management and support requests
- This skill (`godmode-onboarding`) handles the actual onboarding flow
- Both log to `~/godmode/support-logs/` for admin visibility

---

## Supported Channels

### Telegram

**Flow:** Group chat → DM

1. Admin creates a group with the new person and the support bot
2. Admin @mentions the bot to introduce the user
3. {{ALLY_NAME}} adds person to allowlist
4. {{ALLY_NAME}} directs them to DM
5. Onboarding happens in DM (no @mention needed)

**Allowlist location:** `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` → `channels.telegram.allowFrom`

### Slack

**Flow:** Group DM → Same thread or 1:1 DM

1. Admin creates group DM with new person + @{{ALLY_NAME}}
2. Admin introduces them
3. {{ALLY_NAME}} adds person to allowlist (if needed)
4. Onboarding can happen right in the group DM (more natural for Slack)
5. Or {{ALLY_NAME}} can suggest moving to 1:1 DM for focused setup

**Allowlist location:** `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` → `channels.slack.dm.allowFrom`

**Slack-specific notes:**

- Group DMs don't require @mention ({{ALLY_NAME}} sees all messages)
- User IDs look like `U05ET03BGAC`
- Use Slack's threading for multi-step flows

---

## Entry Points

### 1. Telegram - From Group Chat Introduction

Admin introduces new person in Telegram group, {{ALLY_NAME}} adds them to allowlist, they DM the bot.

**First message from user might be:**

- "Hey"
- "My team lead told me to message you"
- "Help me set up GodMode"
- Just a wave emoji

**{{ALLY_NAME}} response:**

```
Welcome to GodMode, I'm your AI Ally. I'll be your chief of staff, executive assistant, strategic partner, and more. Let's get started.

I'll walk you through getting everything set up. It takes about
30 minutes, and by the end you'll have your own personal AI
operating system running.

Ready to start? Just say "yes" or "let's go" and we'll begin!
```

### 2. Slack - From Group DM Introduction

Admin creates group DM with new person and {{ALLY_NAME}}. Onboarding can happen right there.

**Admin's intro:**

```
Hey @{{ALLY_NAME}}, meet Alex. They're joining the team and need to get
set up with GodMode.
```

**{{ALLY_NAME}} response:**

```
Hey Alex! Great to meet you. I'm {{ALLY_NAME}}, your AI assistant.

I'll help you get GodMode set up on your machine. Should we
do this here, or would you prefer I DM you directly so we
have a focused space?

Either works great - just let me know!
```

### 3. From Get Help Button

User clicked "Get Help" in GodMode UI, hasn't been onboarded yet.

**{{ALLY_NAME}} response:**

```
Hey there! I see you're reaching out from GodMode.

I don't think we've met yet - I'm {{ALLY_NAME}}, your AI assistant.
Would you like me to help you get fully set up, or do you
have a specific question I can help with?
```

---

## Onboarding Flow

### Phase 1: Welcome & Context (2 minutes)

**Goal:** Make them feel welcome and set expectations. Offer escape hatches early.

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Hey! I'm so excited to help you get set up. I'm {{ALLY_NAME}}, your AI
       assistant — think of me like a really patient tech friend who's
       done this a hundred times.

       Before we dive in, a few things:

       ⏱️ This usually takes 20-30 minutes
       ☕ You can take breaks anytime — just say 'pause'
       ❓ There's no such thing as a dumb question
       📞 If you'd rather do this on a call with the team, just say so!

       First question: What's your name? And how did you hear about
       GodMode? (Just making sure I have the right context!)"
```

**Capture:**

- Name
- Relationship (friend, team member, customer)
- Technical comfort level (ask naturally, don't quiz)

**After they answer:**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Great to meet you, [name]! Alright, let's get you set up.
       I'll guide you through each step — just follow along and
       we'll have you up and running in no time. 🚀"
```

### Phase 2: System Check (5 minutes)

**Goal:** Determine their setup path and verify readiness. Keep it conversational!

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Quick question to figure out the best path for you:

       What kind of computer are you on right now?
       - Mac
       - Windows PC
       - Something else

       (No wrong answers here!)"
```

**Route based on answer:**

| Device     | Preference | Path                                    |
| ---------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Mac        | Local      | Standard local installation (Phase 3)   |
| Mac        | VPS        | VPS installation (Phase 3-VPS)          |
| Windows PC | Any        | VPS installation required (Phase 3-VPS) |
| Linux      | Local      | Standard local installation (Phase 3)   |

**If Windows — make it sound easy, not limiting:**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Windows! Great. So here's the deal: GodMode runs on Linux, but
       don't worry — we'll set up a little cloud computer for you. It's
       like having a Mac Mini in the sky ☁️

       It costs about $24/month and you can access it
       from anywhere. Plus, it runs 24/7, so your AI never sleeps.

       Sound good? I'll walk you through every single step."
```

**If Mac — offer the choice:**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Nice, a Mac! You have two options:

       1. **Run it on your Mac** — Free, simple, but only works when
          your Mac is on
       2. **Run it in the cloud** — $24/month, runs 24/7, access from
          anywhere

       Most people go with option 2 for the always-on magic. What sounds
       better to you?"
```

**If they seem nervous about "cloud" or "server":**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "I know 'cloud server' sounds techy, but I promise it's not scary.
       Think of it like renting a tiny computer that lives in a data center.
       You'll never have to manage it — just set it up once and forget it.

       And I'll be here the whole time. Ready?"
```

**If issues:**

- Not admin → "No worries! Can you grab someone with admin access, or should we schedule this for when you can get help?"
- No internet → "Looks like we might have a connection issue. Want to try again in a bit?"

### Phase 3-VPS: VPS + Tailscale Setup (20 minutes)

```

```

**IMPORTANT SEQUENCING:** Tailscale must be set up on BOTH machines before GodMode installation begins. The flow is:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│  STEP 2: Install Tailscale on VPS (your cloud server)          │
│  ↓                                                              │
│  STEP 3: Install Tailscale on YOUR PC (your local machine)     │

│  STEP 5: ONLY THEN install GodMode on VPS                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Do NOT skip to GodMode installation until Tailscale is working on both ends!**

#### Step 1: Create DigitalOcean Droplet

**🎉 MILESTONE: After this step, you'll have your very own cloud server!**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Alright, let's create your cloud server! This is the fun part —
       you're basically about to spin up your own computer in the cloud. 🚀

       It's all point-and-click, no scary terminal stuff yet.

       1. Open this link: https://cloud.digitalocean.com/
       2. Create an account if you don't have one (Google login works!)
       3. Once you're in, click the green 'Create' button → 'Droplets'
       4. Pick these options:
          - **Region**: Pick whatever's closest to you (any is fine)
          - **Image**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (should be the default)
          - **Size**: The $24/month one (Basic, 4GB RAM / 2 vCPU) ← Don't skimp!
          - **Password**: Create a root password you'll remember!
       5. Click 'Create Droplet' and wait ~60 seconds

       ⏱️ Takes about 2 minutes total
       👀 You'll see: A new "droplet" appear with an IP address (like 123.45.67.89)
       ✅ Success: You see your droplet with a green dot = it's running!

       Let me know when you see that IP address!"
```

**When they share the IP:**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Perfect! Your very own cloud server is alive! 🎉

       That IP address ([their IP]) is like your server's phone number —
       we'll use it to connect in a second.

       You're doing great. Ready for step 2?"
```

---

#### Step 2: Install Tailscale on VPS

**🎉 MILESTONE: After this, your server joins your private network!**

**Heads up for {{ALLY_NAME}}:** This is where the terminal comes in. Be EXTRA supportive.

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Okay, now we're going to do something that looks techy but is
       actually just copy-paste. We need to connect to your server and
       install Tailscale (it's like a secure tunnel between your computers).

       First, we need to open a connection to your server. This is called SSH.

       **On Windows:** Open PowerShell (search for it in the Start menu)
       **On Mac:** Open Terminal (search for it in Spotlight)

       Then copy-paste this EXACT line (replace YOUR_IP with the IP you got):

       `ssh root@YOUR_IP_ADDRESS`

       ⏱️ Takes: 5 seconds
       👀 You'll see: 'Are you sure you want to continue connecting? (yes/no)'
       ✅ Type: yes (then press Enter)
       🔑 Then it asks for your password — type the one you created earlier
          (you won't see the characters as you type — that's normal and secure!)

       Let me know when you're in! You'll see something like 'root@droplet:~#'"
```

**When they're connected:**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "You're in! 🎉 You're now controlling your cloud server from your
       computer. How cool is that?

       Now let's install Tailscale. Copy-paste this magic spell:

       `curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh`

       ⏱️ Takes: About 30 seconds
       👀 You'll see: Lots of text scrolling — that's normal!
       🙈 Ignore: Any yellow 'warnings' — they're fine
       ✅ Success: Ends with instructions about 'tailscale up'

       Let me know when it stops scrolling!"
```

**After Tailscale installs:**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Beautiful! Now let's activate it. Copy-paste:

       `tailscale up`

       ⏱️ Takes: 10 seconds
       👀 You'll see: A URL that looks like https://login.tailscale.com/...
       ✅ Action: Copy that URL and open it in your browser!

       Sign in with Google, Microsoft, or GitHub — whatever's easiest.
       Then come back and tell me when you see 'Success' in the terminal!"
```

**When they succeed:**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Step 2 of 4 complete! 🎉 Your server is now on your private network.

       You're 50% done. The hardest part is honestly behind you."
```

---

#### Step 3: Install Tailscale on YOUR PC

**🎉 MILESTONE: After this, your computer and server can talk to each other!**

**⚠️ CRITICAL for {{ALLY_NAME}}:** Make sure they know this is on THEIR computer, not the server!

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Okay, quick pit stop — we need to do something on YOUR computer now,
       not the server.

       You can minimize that PowerShell/Terminal window (don't close it!).

       Now let's install Tailscale on your PC so it can talk to your server.

       **On Windows:**
       1. Open this link: https://tailscale.com/download/windows
       2. Download and run the installer (just click through — all defaults are fine)
       3. When it's installed, Tailscale will appear in your system tray (bottom right)
       4. Click the Tailscale icon and click 'Log in'

       **On Mac:**
       1. Open this link: https://tailscale.com/download/mac
       2. Download and install from the App Store
       3. Click the Tailscale icon in your menu bar and click 'Log in'

       🔑 IMPORTANT: Use the SAME account you used on the server!
          (This is how it knows they're both yours)

       Let me know when you're logged in!"
```

**If login button doesn't work (common on Windows):**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Hmm, that button can be finicky on Windows. No worries! Let's do it
       the reliable way.

       1. Open PowerShell (search for it in Start menu)
       2. Copy-paste this exactly:

          & 'C:\Program Files\Tailscale\tailscale.exe' login

       3. It'll print a URL — copy it and open it in your browser
       4. Sign in with the SAME account you used on the server

       Let me know when you're logged in!"
```

**Alternative if still not working:**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Still having trouble? Let's try a few things:

       1. Make sure you have a default browser set:
          Windows Settings → Apps → Default apps → Web browser

       2. Try temporarily setting Edge as your default browser

       3. Check Windows Firewall allows Tailscale:
          Search 'Firewall' → Allow app through firewall → Check Tailscale

       4. If antivirus is blocking it, temporarily disable it

       If none of that works, we can use the PowerShell method above."
```

---

#### Step 4: VERIFY Tailscale Connection

**🎉 MILESTONE: The magic moment — your computers can talk to each other!**

**⚠️ DO NOT PROCEED UNTIL THIS WORKS!**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Okay, moment of truth! Let's make sure your PC and server can
       see each other through Tailscale.

       On your PC, open PowerShell (or Terminal on Mac) and type:

       `tailscale status`

       👀 You should see: TWO devices listed — your PC AND your server
       ✅ Look for: Both showing 'online' or with green checkmarks

       If you see both, try this ping test:

       `ping [YOUR_VPS_TAILSCALE_IP]`

       (The IP looks like 100.x.x.x — copy it from tailscale status)

       ⏱️ Let it run for a few seconds
       ✅ Success: You see 'Reply from...' messages
       ❌ Problem: 'Request timed out' — let me know and we'll fix it!

       What do you see?"
```

**If it works:**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "BOOM! 🎉 Your PC and server are connected through your own private
       network! This is the hardest part done.

       Step 3 of 4 complete! Just one more step and you're golden."
```

**If ping fails — stay calm and supportive:**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "No worries, this is a common hiccup. Let's figure it out together.

       First, let's check both devices are on the same Tailscale account:

       On your PC, run:
       `tailscale status`

       Then go back to your VPS terminal and run:
       `tailscale status`

       Both should show the same 'tailnet' name at the top (looks like
       your-account@example.com or yourname.github).

       Are they the same?"
```

**If different accounts:**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Ah, that's the issue! They're on different accounts, so they can't
       see each other. Easy fix:

       On your VPS, run:
       `tailscale logout && tailscale up`

       This will give you a new login URL — make sure to log in with the
       SAME account as your PC this time!

       Let me know when you've done that and we'll try the ping again."
```

---

#### Step 5: Install GodMode on VPS

**🎉 MILESTONE: The main event! After this, GodMode is alive!**

**Only proceed once Step 4 ping test works!**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "This is it — the big one! We're about to install GodMode on your
       server. This is the longest step, but it's basically just waiting.

       First, go back to your VPS terminal. If you closed it, reconnect with:

       `ssh root@YOUR_VPS_IP`

       Then copy-paste this ONE command (it's long but just copy the whole thing):

       `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GodMode-Team/godmode/main/scripts/install.sh | bash`

       ⏱️ Takes: 3-5 minutes (perfect time for a coffee!)
       👀 You'll see: LOTS of text scrolling — downloading, installing, etc.
       🙈 Ignore: Yellow warnings, 'deprecated' messages — all normal
       ⚠️ Watch for: It will ASK you questions — don't walk away!

       This will:
       1. Install Node.js
       2. Install pnpm
       3. Clone and build GodMode
       4. Ask you for authentication

       When it asks for auth method, choose 'Claude Max (setup-token)'

       Let me know when the install completes!"
```

**After install completes — VERIFY CONFIG (CRITICAL):**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Great, install finished! Let's do a quick check to make sure
       the config file is set up right.

       Run this:

       `ls ~/.openclaw/*.json`

       👀 You should see: openclaw.json
       ❌ If you ONLY see config.json: run this to fix it:
          `cp ~/.openclaw/config.json ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`

       Then verify the gateway mode is set:

       `grep mode ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`

       👀 You should see: 'mode': 'local'

       Let me know what you see!"
```

**Why this matters:** The gateway reads `openclaw.json` (NOT `config.json`). Without the correct filename AND `mode: "local"`, the gateway will refuse to start. This is the #1 post-update trap — see Production Gotchas #6 and #7.

**ALWAYS ask about Claude subscription status BEFORE starting auth setup:**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Almost there! Just need to set up your AI connection.

       Quick question: Do you happen to have a Claude Pro or Claude Max
       subscription? (That's the $20/month thing from Anthropic — you might
       use it for Claude.ai)

       No worries if you're not sure or don't have one — just let me know
       either way and I'll guide you through the right path!"
```

**If they say yes to Claude Pro/Max — make it sound easy:**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Oh perfect! That makes things even easier. We'll use your existing
       subscription so you don't have to pay anything extra.

       Just need to grab a special token from it. Let me walk you through..."
```

**If they say no or not sure:**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "No problem! We'll set up an API key — it's free to start and you
       only pay for what you use (and for personal use, it's usually pennies).

```

**If user has Claude Pro/Max subscription:**

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**If user says "I don't have CLI installed":**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "No worries at all! Let's install it real quick — just one command.

       Copy-paste this:

       `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`

       ⏱️ Takes: About 20 seconds
       👀 You'll see: Some download progress, then it finishes
       🙈 Ignore: Any 'deprecated' warnings — totally fine

       When that's done, run:

       `claude setup-token`

       This will open your browser to log into Claude. Sign in, and then
       copy the token it gives you (starts with 'sk-ant-oat01-...').

       Let me know when you have it!"
```

**If CLI install fails (npm not found):**

```bash
# Install Node.js first
curl -fsSL https://fnm.vercel.app/install | bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
fnm install 22
fnm use 22

# Then install Claude Code
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

**If OAuth fails (error 400 or similar):**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "OAuth errors sometimes happen with network or browser issues.
       Let's try the direct token method instead:

       1. Open a NEW terminal window

       4. After login, copy the token it outputs
       5. Paste that token here

       If browser doesn't open, try:
       claude setup-token --no-browser

       Then manually visit the URL it prints."
```

**⚠️ NEVER fall back to raw API key when user has Claude Pro/Max!**

A raw API key from console.anthropic.com:

- Creates a NEW billing account (costs money)
- Has harsh rate limits (10K tokens/minute on Opus)
- Doesn't use their existing Claude Pro subscription

---

### Team Credentials via 1Password (Alternative Path)

**If user is a GodMode team member:**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Since you're on the GodMode team, you can use our shared
       API credentials from the team password manager.

       1. Get the shared Anthropic API key from your team lead
          or your team's password manager.

       2. Add it to your config:
          echo 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<paste-key>' >> ~/.openclaw/.env"
```

This uses the team's shared API key with proper rate limits.

```

---

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Authentication Routing

**This is the #1 failure point in onboarding. Get this right.**

#### Decision Tree for Auth Method

```

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ User says "Claude Pro" / "Claude Max" / "Claude subscription" │
│ ↓ │
│ THEY MUST USE: Claude CLI setup-token flow │
│ ↓ │
│ 1. Install Claude Code CLI first: │
│ npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code │
│ 2. Generate token: │
│ claude setup-token │
│ 3. Paste token into wizard (starts with sk-ant-oat01-) │
│ │
│ NEVER tell them to use "Anthropic API key" option! │
│ NEVER send them to console.anthropic.com! │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ User is TEAM MEMBER                              │
│ ↓ │
│ USE team password manager for API keys: │
│ 1. Get the shared key from your team lead │
│ 2. Add to ~/.openclaw/.env │
│ ↓ │
│ Team keys have proper rate limits. Personal keys do NOT. │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

````

#### Common Failures and How to Handle

| What User Says | WRONG Response | RIGHT Response |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| "We have Claude Pro" | "Use Anthropic API key" | "Install Claude CLI, run `claude setup-token`" |
| "I don't have CLI installed" | "Just use API key instead" | "Let's install it: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`" |
| "OAuth error 400" | "Fall back to API key" | "Try `claude setup-token` in terminal instead" |
| "CLI won't sign in" | "Use API key" | Debug the CLI issue, or use setup-token flow |

#### If OAuth Fails

**NEVER fall back to raw API keys.** The setup-token flow works without OAuth:

```bash
# This ALWAYS works, even when OAuth is broken:
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
claude setup-token

# User pastes the token (starts with sk-ant-oat01-) into the wizard
````

#### Rate Limit Reality Check

| Auth Source                          | Opus Rate Limit     |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Personal Anthropic key (new account) | 10K tokens/min ❌   |
| Claude Pro setup-token               | Higher limits ✓     |
| Team 1Password key                   | Production limits ✓ |

**A new personal API key will hit rate limits within minutes of normal use.**

---

### 🛑 ESCALATION TRIGGER: When to Stop and Escalate

**If you find yourself thinking "let's just use API key, it's simpler" — STOP.**

This is the exact reasoning pattern that has cost users hours. Instead:

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "[To admin] Auth is failing for [user]. I'm tempted to suggest API key
       fallback but that's marked as never-do. Options:

       1. Debug the CLI/OAuth issue
       2. Use 1Password team credentials
       3. You take over auth setup

       What do you want me to do?"
```

**Triggers for this escalation:**

- OAuth returns error 400+ and user has Claude Pro/Max
- CLI install fails and you're considering API key instead
- User is visibly frustrated and you want to "just make it work"
- You've been on auth setup for >15 minutes without success

**Do NOT escalate for:**

- User genuinely doesn't have Claude subscription (API key is correct path)
- Minor CLI install issues you can debug yourself
- Normal troubleshooting that's making progress

---

### Phase 3: Installation (15 minutes)

**Goal:** Install GodMode core components.

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Great! Now let's install GodMode. I'll walk you through
       each step - just let me know when you're ready for the next one.

       Step 1: Open Terminal
       - Press Cmd+Space, type 'Terminal', press Enter
       - Let me know when you have it open"
```

**Steps:**

1. Open Terminal
2. Install Homebrew (if not present)
3. Install Tailscale
4. Join the GodMode network (provide auth key)
5. Enable Tailscale SSH
6. Clone GodMode repo (team members have access)
7. Run setup script

**At each step:**

- Wait for confirmation before proceeding
- Offer to explain what each command does
- Handle errors gracefully

**Installation commands:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ⚠️ CRITICAL: USE PNPM — NEVER NPM                              │
│                                                                 │
│  This is a pnpm workspace. Using npm will BREAK the install.   │
│  If you see ERR_PNPM_RECURSIVE_EXEC_FIRST_FAIL, you either:    │
│    1. Used npm instead of pnpm, OR                             │
│    2. Skipped `pnpm install` before running other commands     │
│                                                                 │
│  Recovery: rm -rf node_modules && pnpm install                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

```bash
# Clone the repo (team members have access)
git clone https://github.com/GodMode-Team/godmode.git ~/GodMode

# MANDATORY: Initialize workspace with pnpm (NOT npm!)
cd ~/GodMode
pnpm install   # ← THIS MUST RUN FIRST, WITH PNPM

# If you accidentally used npm, recover with:
# rm -rf node_modules && pnpm install
```

### Phase 3.5: Memory System Setup (5 minutes)

**Goal:** Set up the full memory system for semantic search.

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Now let's set up your memory system. This gives you
       semantic search across all your notes and conversations.

       Run these commands one at a time:"
```

**Step 1: Install QMD (Quick Markdown Search)**

```bash
# Install bun if not present
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Install QMD globally
~/.bun/bin/bun install -g qmd
```

**Step 2: Create memory directories**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/godmode/memory/{learnings,people,projects}
```

**Step 3: Initialize QMD collection**

```bash
~/.bun/bin/qmd collection add ~/godmode --name godmode --mask "**/*.md"
~/.bun/bin/qmd embed
```

**Step 4: Verify OpenAI API key is set**
The memory system uses OpenAI embeddings. Verify the key is in `~/.openclaw/.env`:

```bash
grep OPENAI_API_KEY ~/.openclaw/.env
```

If missing, add it:

```bash
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-..." >> ~/.openclaw/.env
```

**Memory system features:**

- **Hybrid search**: Vector (semantic) + BM25 (keyword) combined
- **Session memory**: Past conversations are searchable
- **Auto-sync**: Memory indexes update every 30 minutes
- **QMD CLI**: `qmd search "query"` for quick searches

### Phase 4: Configuration (5 minutes)

**Goal:** Basic personalization.

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "GodMode is installed! Now let's personalize it.

       What time do you usually wake up? I'll set your daily
       brief to arrive just before then."
```

**Configure:**

- Daily brief time
- Timezone (auto-detect or ask)
- Preferred name (how {{ALLY_NAME}} should address them)

### Phase 5: First Experience (5 minutes)

**Goal:** Show immediate value — make them smile!

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Okay, GodMode is running! 🎉 Let's take it for a spin.

       Try asking me something — anything! Like:
       - 'What's on my calendar today?'
       - 'Tell me a joke'
       - 'What can you do?'

       Go ahead, I'm ready!"
```

**After they try it:**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "See? That's your AI assistant, running on YOUR server, available
       24/7. Pretty cool, right?

       Just one more quick thing and we're done..."
```

**Demo capabilities:**

- Answer a question
- Show them something useful
- Create something small (note, reminder, etc.)

### Phase 6: VERIFICATION GATE (REQUIRED)

**Goal:** Quick sanity check to make sure everything's working — but keep it light!

```

│  Run these checks WITH the user, not silently.                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Frame it as exciting, not scary:**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Before we pop the champagne, let's do a quick health check —
       just to make sure everything's running perfectly.

       Run this command on your server:

       `godmode health`

       What does it show?"
```

**Check 1: Health Status**

**What to look for:**

- ✅ "All systems operational" → "Perfect! All green!"
- ❌ "Rate limit: 10K tokens/min" → WRONG AUTH - Stop and fix
- ❌ Any red errors → Troubleshoot before proceeding

**If everything's green:**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "All systems go! 🟢 Beautiful."
```

**Check 2: Auth Token Type**

If user has Claude Pro/Max, verify they're using the right token:

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "One more quick check — let's verify your AI key is set up right.

       Run this:

       `grep ANTHROPIC ~/.openclaw/.env`

       What does it show? (Just need to see what letters it starts with)"
```

**What to look for:**

- `sk-ant-oat01-...` (setup-token) → ✅ "Perfect! That's the right one."
- `sk-ant-api03-...` (API key) → ⚠️ Check if user has Claude Pro

**If API key when user has Claude Pro/Max — don't panic them:**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Hmm, I see you're using a regular API key, but earlier you mentioned
       having Claude Pro. Let me explain why this matters:

       Regular API keys have really strict limits (like 10K tokens/minute),
       which means your AI would slow down or stop during longer tasks.

       Your Claude Pro subscription has much better limits! Let's switch to
       that real quick — it'll only take a minute:

       `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
       `claude setup-token`

       Then we'll update your config with the new token."
```

**Check 3: Send/Receive Test**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Last check! Let's make sure we can actually talk.

       Send me a message that just says: ping

       I'll confirm I got it!"
```

**When they send ping:**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Got it! 🎉 Communication confirmed. We're in business."
```

**Check 4: Rate Limit Reality Check**

For users who set up new auth:

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Let me just send you a longer message to make sure your rate
       limits are healthy... [send a moderate-length response]

       If you're reading this without any errors, your setup is solid! ✅"
```

```

### Phase 7: What's Next (2 minutes)

**Goal:** Celebrate, set expectations, and make them excited to explore!

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "🎉 YOU DID IT! 🎉

       From zero to your own personal AI system in [X] minutes.
       Honestly? That's impressive. Most people don't get this far.

       Here's what happens next:

       📬 **Tomorrow morning** — You'll get your first Daily Brief
          (a personalized summary to start your day)

       🔍 **Next few days** — I'll check in with some cool features
          to try. No pressure, just ideas!

       💬 **Anytime** — Just message me here. I'm always on.

       You now have something most people don't: an AI that runs 24/7,
       knows your context, and is genuinely trying to help you.

       Welcome to GodMode. 🚀

       Any questions before I let you explore?"
```

**If they ask a question — answer warmly and end on a high note:**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "[Answer their question]

       Alright, I'll let you go explore! Remember, I'm here whenever
       you need me. Have fun! 🙌"
```

**If they say no questions:**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Perfect! Go play around, break things, ask me dumb questions —
       that's how you'll learn what I can do.

       Talk soon! 👋"
```

---

## Handling Common Situations

### User is Overwhelmed

**Signs:** Long pauses, "this is a lot", "I'm confused", frustrated tone

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Hey, I can tell this is a lot. That's totally valid — this stuff
       IS technical, even if I'm trying to make it easy.

       Real talk: we can absolutely take a break. There's no timer here.

       Options:
       🧘 Take 10 minutes, grab coffee, come back fresh
       📅 Stop here and pick this up tomorrow
       📞 Schedule a call with the team and do this together

       What sounds good? No wrong answer."
```

### User Asks Off-Topic Question

**Don't shut them down — curiosity is good!**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Oh that's a great question! [Brief, friendly answer]

       Want to dig into that more after we finish setup? We're about
       [X]% done — just [Y] more steps and then we can explore whatever
       you want!"
```

### Installation Fails

**Stay calm and supportive — errors are normal!**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Hmm, looks like something got tripped up. Don't worry — this happens
       and it's usually an easy fix.

       Can you do one of these for me?
       - Copy-paste the error message you see, OR
       - Take a screenshot and send it here

       I'll figure out what's going on!"
```

**If can't resolve:**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Okay, this one's being stubborn! I'm going to flag this for the team —
       they're the wizards for the weird edge cases.

       Someone will reach out to help you finish up. In the meantime, you've done
       great getting this far — the hard parts are behind you.

       Anything else I can help with while we wait?"
```

### User Wants to Stop

**Make them feel good about pausing, not guilty:**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Totally fine! Life happens.

       Good news: I've saved exactly where we are. When you come back,
       just message me and say 'continue setup' — we'll pick up right
       where we left off. No starting over!

       Take care, and message me whenever you're ready. 👋"
```

### User Says "I Broke Something"

**Reassure them immediately:**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "I promise you didn't break anything! These systems are pretty
       resilient, and if something's weird, we can fix it.

       Tell me what you're seeing — what happened, what you expected,
       and any error messages. We'll sort it out together."
```

## Production Gotchas (Tell Users BEFORE They Hit These)

These are hard-won learnings from real deployments. Share them proactively during onboarding to prevent wasted hours.

### 1. Gateway Auth is Required

**The Trap:** Thinking you can run without authentication.

**Reality:** Gateway requires token/password (or Tailscale Serve identity). The old `auth.mode: "none"` was removed for security.

**Tell the user:**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Quick heads up - GodMode requires authentication to access.
       Your setup token is in ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json. Keep it safe!"
```

### 2. NEVER Use `tailscale serve reset`

**The Trap:** Running `tailscale serve reset` to "clean up".

**Reality:** This removes ALL routes, including production. You'll lose access.

**Safe alternative:**

```bash
# Remove specific route only
tailscale serve --https=PORT off

# NOT this (removes everything):
tailscale serve reset  # ⚠️ DANGEROUS
```

**Tell the user:**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Important: if you ever need to remove a Tailscale route, use
       'tailscale serve --https=PORT off' - NEVER use 'reset'!"
```

### 3. Two UIs - Build the Right One

**The Trap:** Running the wrong build command for UI.

**Reality:** The GodMode UI lives at `ui/` inside the plugin repo.

**Correct build:**

```bash
# GodMode UI
pnpm build:ui
```

### 4. Telegram Config Schema

**The Trap:** Using wrong field names from old docs.

**Reality:** Common mistakes that silently break DMs:

| Wrong ❌           | Correct ✓          |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| `token`            | `botToken`         |
| `dm.enabled: true` | `dmPolicy: "open"` |
| Missing            | `allowFrom: ["*"]` |

**Working config:**

```json
{
  "telegram": {
    "enabled": true,
    "botToken": "YOUR_TOKEN",
    "dmPolicy": "open",
    "allowFrom": ["*"]
  }
}
```

### 5. Verify After Every Tailscale Change

**The Trap:** Assuming changes took effect.

**Reality:** Always verify routes after any Tailscale command:

```bash
tailscale serve status
```

**Expected (production Mac Mini):**

```
https://machine-name.tailnet.ts.net → localhost:18789 (production)
https://machine-name.tailnet.ts.net:8443 → localhost:5175 (dev)
```

### 6. Config File MUST Be Named `openclaw.json`

**The Trap:** Having a valid config at `~/.openclaw/config.json`

**Reality:** The gateway specifically reads `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` (hardcoded in `src/config/paths.ts:21`). It completely ignores `config.json`. This is the #1 post-update breakage.

**Symptom:** "Gateway start blocked: set gateway.mode=local (current: unset)" — even though the setting IS in the file.

**Fix:**

```bash
# Check which files exist
ls ~/.openclaw/*.json

# Copy config to correct name if needed
cp ~/.openclaw/config.json ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json

# Verify
openclaw doctor | grep "Config:"
```

**Tell the user:**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "IMPORTANT: Your config file must be named 'openclaw.json', NOT 'config.json'.
       The gateway ignores config.json completely.

       Let's verify: run 'ls ~/.openclaw/*.json' — do you see openclaw.json?"
```

### 7. Gateway Requires `mode: "local"`

**The Trap:** Config exists with correct name but gateway still won't start.

**Reality:** Upstream OpenClaw now requires `"mode": "local"` in the gateway config object. Without it, the gateway exits immediately.

**Symptom:** "Gateway start blocked: set gateway.mode=local (current: unset)"

**Fix:** Add `"mode": "local"` to the gateway object in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "mode": "local",
    ...
  }
}
```

**Tell the user:**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Your gateway config needs 'mode: local' — let me help you add that."
```

**Prevention:** The install script (`scripts/install.sh`) now includes this automatically. The post-pull hook (`git-hooks/post-merge`) checks for it on every `git pull`.

### 8. Gateway Restarts Need Verification

**The Trap:** Restarting the gateway and assuming it's working.

**Reality:** After restart, always check:

```bash
# Is it running?
godmode status

# Is the UI correct?
curl -s http://localhost:18789 | grep "<title>"

# Are channels working?
godmode channels status --probe
```

## Forwarding to Admin

After each onboarding session, send summary to the admin:

**Channel:** Slack DM or web UI notification

**Format:**

```
New Onboarding Complete

Who: [User Name]
When: Today, 3:45 PM CT
Duration: 28 minutes
Status: Fully set up

Highlights:
- Very positive throughout
- Asked about smart home control (interested in future features)
- Brief set for 7:00 AM CT

Questions for admin:
- User asked about cost - I said "beta, no cost yet"
- Confirm that's still accurate?

Next Steps:
- Day 2 check-in tomorrow morning
- Day 3 check-in Thursday
```

---

## Success Criteria

**A successful onboarding must pass Phase 6 Verification Gate.**

Do NOT mark as complete based on vibes. The checklist must pass:

- [ ] User completes all phases (1-7)
- [ ] **Phase 6 Verification Gate PASSED:**
  - [ ] `godmode health` shows no rate limit errors
  - [ ] Auth token type matches subscription status
  - [ ] User confirmed send/receive works
  - [ ] No "10K tokens/min" warnings
- [ ] GodMode is installed and running
- [ ] Memory system configured:
  - [ ] QMD installed (`~/.bun/bin/qmd`)
  - [ ] Memory directories created (`~/godmode/memory/`)
  - [ ] QMD collection initialized
  - [ ] OpenAI API key set for embeddings
- [ ] Daily brief is configured
- [ ] User has positive first experience
- [ ] User knows how to get help
- [ ] Everything is logged
- [ ] Admin received summary
- [ ] Follow-up check-ins scheduled

---

## Escalation

**Escalate to the admin when:**

- Installation fails and can't be resolved
- User has questions about pricing/business terms
- User seems frustrated or wants to talk to a human
- Technical issue beyond {{ALLY_NAME}}'s capability

**How to escalate:**

```
{{ALLY_NAME}}: "Let me get the team involved - they'll be able to help with
       this directly. I've shared our conversation with them and
       someone will reach out [today/soon].

       Is there anything else I can help with in the meantime?"
```

Then notify the admin via Slack with full context.
