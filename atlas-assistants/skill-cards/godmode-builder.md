# GodMode Builder — In-Session Codefix & Deploy

When the user reports a bug or requests a change to GodMode itself, spin up a builder agent to fix AND deploy it live. No PRs, no review queue — the fix goes live and the user is running it within minutes.

## How to Use
1. Listen for bug reports or feature requests about GodMode (memory not working, UI broken, context wrong, etc.)
2. Gather context: what's broken, error messages, reproduction steps
3. Run `godmode_repair` with `action: diagnose` to get current system state
4. Use `queue_add` with:
   - **type:** `coding`
   - **personaHint:** `godmode-builder`
   - **title:** Clear bug/feature description
   - **description:** Include root cause if known, health diagnostics, error details, and specific files involved
   - **priority:** `high` for bugs affecting the user right now, `normal` for enhancements

## What the Builder Agent Does
1. Reads CLAUDE.md for project rules
2. Diagnoses the root cause
3. Creates a fix branch, makes the fix
4. Runs `pnpm build && pnpm typecheck` — both must pass
5. Merges the fix back to the working branch
6. Rebuilds and runs `openclaw gateway restart`
7. **The fix is LIVE** — the user is running it immediately

## After the Builder Reports Back
- Tell the user: "The fix is deployed and live. [summary of what was fixed]"
- If the builder couldn't deploy, tell the user what blocked it and offer to help manually
- The user's next interaction with the fixed subsystem will use the new code

## Context to Include in Description
- Error messages or health ledger alerts
- The subsystem affected (memory, queue, context, UI, etc.)
- Recent repair log entries (use `godmode_repair` with action='history')
- Specific file paths if known
- What the user was doing when it broke

## Example
```
queue_add({
  type: "coding",
  personaHint: "godmode-builder",
  title: "Fix: memory search returns 0 results despite stored vectors",
  description: "Memory search always returns empty. Health shows memory.search at 0% success. Root cause likely in src/services/honcho-client.ts (Honcho cloud memory). Build and deploy live after fix.",
  priority: "high"
})
```
