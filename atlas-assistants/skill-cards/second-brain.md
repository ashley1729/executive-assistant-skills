## When to Use
- User asks about a person, company, project, or any stored knowledge
- You need context about something and memory results above are insufficient
- Looking up past research, meeting notes, or project details
- ANY time you're about to ask the user for info — search here first

## How to Use
- `secondBrain.search` — { query, scope?, limit? } — hybrid QMD 2.0 search (semantic + BM25 + LLM reranking) across the vault. Scopes: "all" (default), "sessions", or vault collection. Falls back to file walk if QMD unavailable.
- `secondBrain.identity` — read USER.md and SOUL.md identity files
- `secondBrain.memoryBank` — list all people/company files
- `secondBrain.memoryBankEntry` — { name } — get a specific person/company file

## Vault Structure (PARA)
- 00-Inbox/ — unsorted captures, queue outputs land here
- 01-Daily/ — daily briefs (YYYY-MM-DD.md)
- 02-Projects/ — active project notes
- 03-Areas/ — ongoing areas of responsibility
- 04-Resources/ — research, references
- 06-Brain/ — People/, Companies/, Knowledge/ files
- 08-Identity/ — USER.md, SOUL.md
- 99-System/ — system files, agent-roster, skill-cards

## Gotchas
- Search uses QMD 2.0 hybrid retrieval (semantic + full-text + reranking) — natural language queries work best but keywords also work via BM25
- People files are in 06-Brain/People/ — search by name
- If search returns nothing, try broader terms or different phrasing
- Vault is the source of truth for long-term knowledge — memory is for conversational context
- All searches are logged to retrieval-log.jsonl for trajectory analysis
- Screenpipe ambient memory (screen/audio captures) feeds into the vault via hourly ingestion — use `ingestion.screenpipeStatus` for status, `secondBrain.search` to query captured content

## Tips
- When user mentions a person, immediately search for their people file
- Cross-reference meeting attendees with people files before meeting prep
- For "what do we know about X" — search vault, then summarize findings
- Don't quote raw vault content — synthesize it naturally into conversation
