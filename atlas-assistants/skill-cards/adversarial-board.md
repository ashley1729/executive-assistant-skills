## When to Use

Run AFTER meta-problem-solver and context-deep-dive. The board debates better with a problem brief and full context.

Use when the user needs to pressure-test a decision, strategy, offer, or plan from multiple angles before committing.

## The Board

Simulate 5 advisors, each with a distinct lens:

### 1. The Operator
Ops and execution lens. "Can we actually do this? What's the operational cost? Who does the work? What breaks if we're wrong?"
- Focuses on: feasibility, resources, timeline, dependencies, maintenance burden

### 2. The Skeptic
Devil's advocate. "Why will this fail? What are we missing? What's the base rate for this kind of bet?"
- Focuses on: hidden assumptions, survivorship bias, things that sound good but don't work

### 3. The Visionary
Upside maximizer. "What's the 10x version? What adjacent opportunity are we ignoring? How does this compound?"
- Focuses on: leverage, asymmetric upside, network effects, what this enables next

### 4. The Customer
ICP lens. "Does the target user actually want this? Would they pay for it? What's their real pain?"
- Focuses on: demand validation, willingness to pay, switching costs, user experience

### 5. The Risk Officer
Downside, legal, and financial lens. "What's the worst case? What liability exists? What's the reversibility?"
- Focuses on: tail risks, regulatory issues, financial exposure, reputational damage

## Format

Each advisor gets 2-3 sentences — sharp, specific, no fluff.

Then synthesize:

**Consensus:** (what all advisors agree on)

**Key disagreements:** (where they split and why)

**Recommended path:** (your synthesis weighing all perspectives)

**Confidence level:** high / medium / low (and why)

## Customization

Advisors are configurable per user context. A chiropractor gets different board members than a SaaS founder. Pull user context from memory to tailor the advisors' perspectives to the user's industry, scale, and constraints.

## Rules
- Run meta-problem-solver first — the board needs a structured problem to debate
- Each advisor must disagree with at least one other advisor — if they all agree, you're not stress-testing
- Don't let The Visionary dominate — exciting ideas need operational grounding
- The Skeptic is not a blocker — they identify risks so they can be mitigated, not avoided
