## When to Use
- User mentions "last call", "my call", "the call", "that meeting" — always check Fathom first
- Analyzing, summarizing, or debriefing a meeting/call
- Extracting action items, decisions, or follow-ups from a call
- Looking up what was discussed with a specific person

## How to Use
- `fathom.listMeetings` — list recent recordings (use `{ limit: 5 }` or `{ limit: 1 }` for "last call")
- `fathom.getMeeting` — get full details including transcript, summary, action items `{ id: <recordingId> }`
- `fathom.ingest` — pull a specific recording from the Fathom API by ID `{ recordingId: <id> }`
- Fathom is ALWAYS the source for call recordings. NEVER ask the user where the recording is — just check Fathom.

## Workflow
1. Call `fathom.listMeetings` to find the relevant recording
2. If user said "last call" — grab the most recent one
3. If user mentioned a person — match against attendee names/emails
4. Call `fathom.getMeeting` with the recording ID for full transcript + summary
5. Analyze, summarize, extract action items, or answer the user's question

## Gotchas
- Recordings arrive via webhook after the call ends — there may be a few minutes delay
- The meeting queue file is at `~/godmode/data/meeting-queue.json` — don't read it directly, use the RPC
- Transcripts can be long — summarize before presenting unless the user asks for the full thing
- Action items from Fathom are auto-extracted — cross-reference with what the user actually wants to do
- If `fathom.listMeetings` returns empty, the webhook may not be configured — suggest `fathom.setupWebhook`

## Tips
- After analyzing a call, offer to create GodMode tasks from action items
- Cross-reference attendees with vault people files via secondBrain.search
- Suggest updating person memory files with new context from the call
- If external attendees were present, offer to draft a follow-up email
